SafeTalk
SafeTalk is a counseling support platform designed to offer anonymous users a safe space for seeking guidance and support. Our platform provides various features such as chat support, voice calls, and one-way video calls to facilitate effective communication between users and mentors.

Features
Chat Support: Users can engage in text-based conversations with trained mentors to discuss their concerns and seek guidance.

Voice Call: Users have the option to initiate voice calls with mentors for more personalized support and assistance.

One-Way Video Call: Users can choose to have one-way video calls with mentors, allowing them to see and hear the mentor while remaining anonymous themselves.

Random User ID: Upon signup, users are assigned a random ID instead of using their names, ensuring anonymity and privacy.

Account Recovery Codes: In case users forget their passwords, they are provided with account recovery codes to regain access to their accounts securely.

No Email Storage: SafeTalk prioritizes user privacy by not storing any emails or personal information of users.

Mentor Signup: Mentors can sign up by providing complete details and portfolios, ensuring that users have access to qualified and experienced professionals.
