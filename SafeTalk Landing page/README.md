## We have developed a platform for anonymous counseling for users. SafeTalk is a platform where users can create accounts with anonymous IDâ€™s and get access to professional counselors based on their needs. 

### Key features of this project are:
-	We will not store any email or personal information of the user, instead we will be providing a recovery code to users for recovering their forgotten passwords.
-	We will provide features such as one way video call, voice call, chat support etc to provide user anonymity
-	Users will be provided with full information of counselors for selecting the perfect mentor they wish to take sessions with.

## All Features
- Random User ID: Upon signup, users are assigned a random ID instead of using their names, ensuring anonymity and privacy.
- Account Recovery Codes: In case users forget their passwords, they are provided with account recovery codes to regain access to their accounts securely.
- No Email Storage: SafeTalk prioritizes user privacy by not storing any emails or personal information of users.
- Mentor Signup: Mentors can sign up by providing complete details and portfolios, ensuring that users have access to qualified and experienced professionals.
- Chat Support: Users can engage in text-based conversations with trained mentors to discuss their concerns and seek guidance.
- Voice Call: Users have the option to initiate voice calls with mentors for more personalized support and assistance.
- One-Way Video Call: Users can choose to have one-way video calls with mentors, allowing them to see and hear the mentor while remaining anonymous themselves.
###Pricing
- Initial Trial: We offer an initial trial period for free, allowing users to experience our platform and services before committing to paid sessions.

- Subscription Charges: After the trial period, users will be charged for additional sessions. We offer flexible subscription plans to suit different needs and budgets.


# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
